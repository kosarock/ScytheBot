# ScytheBot - configurable Python3 IRC bot

## Installation

In order to use the bot you should:
* copy ircbot/ directory to whatever place you like (preferably $HOME/.ircbot )
* change paths in ircbot/config.py and run.py to match whatever paths to the files are
* edit your config.py to contain proper data

## TODO

Things yet to be added or changed:
* support for multiple nicks in case the first is not available
* non-IRC interface to manage the bot while it's connected
* more detailed README.md with good configuration description
* documenting the code
* refactoring stuff
